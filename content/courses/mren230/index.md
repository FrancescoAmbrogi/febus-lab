description: "Introductory course on thermodynamics and heat transfer for mechatronics engineers" 
summary: "This course introduces fundamental thermodynamics and heat transfer concepts needed to analyze thermal systems including ideal gas laws; work and heat; conservation of energy; thermodynamic properties of pure substances; equations of state; applications to open and closed systems; heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation. Theory will be complemented with a series of labs that introduce temperature measurement devices and thermal circuit analysis."

## Course learning outcomes

+ Define the basic concepts of thermodynamics.
+ Define the thermodynamic properties of pure substances.
+ Apply the First Law to energy balances in open and closed systems
such as compressors, turbines, and equipment enclosures. 
+ Apply the First and Second Laws to the analysis of simple vapour
power and refrigeration cycles.
+ Identify and analyze engineering problems involving the three basic
modes of heat transfer, i.e., conduction, convection, and radiation.
+ Conduct experiments to measure and analyze heat transfer and
thermal systems.

## Course material

The suggested textbook is: Y.A. Cengel, J.M. Cimbala, A.J. Gafar, Fundamentals of Thermal-Fluid Sciences - 6th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2022.

Students are strongly encouraged to follow the 3-hours/weekly lectures and to take notes.

All other course material is accessible via OnQ. Attendance at lectures is strongly recommended as ONLY material covered in class will be included in the tests. The instructor will also post weekly readings (optional for the students) on Connect to help students familiarize with the material and be on track with the course content.

## Course structure and activities

The course is taught in one section with the following structure:
+ 3 in-class lectures per week
+ 1 in-class tutorial per week
