description: "Introductory course on fluid mechanics and fluid power for mechatronics engineers" 
summary: "An introductory course in fluid mechanics with application to fluid power systems. Topics include properties of fluids, fluids at rest, dimensional analysis, the laws of conservation of mass and momentum, Bernoulli's equation for incompressible flow and the energy equation, flow measurements, elementary pipe flow problems including losses due to pumps, valves etc. Laboratories will introduce students to pressure and flow measuring devices, pneumatic and hydraulic components and actuators, and circuit analysis of fluid power systems."

## Course learning outcomes

+ Define fluid properties and basic concepts of fluid flow and scaling.
+ Determine forces applied by fluids at rest.
+ Apply energy and momentum balance to analyze fluid power
systems using integral equations and balances. 
+ Solve scaling problems using dimensionless groups.
+ Analyze flow through piping systems with friction, minor losses,
valves, pumps, and cylinders
+ Identify and assemble components necessary for the design of fluid
power systems.
+ Solve flow system performance problems using Bernoulli with
friction, minor losses, pump, and fan performance curves.
+ Conduct experiments to measure and analyze fluid and fluid power
systems.

## Course material

The suggested textbook is: Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, Eight Edition, Munson et al. (Wiley)

Students are strongly encouraged to follow the 3-hours/weekly lectures and to take notes.

All other course material is accessible via OnQ. Attendance at lectures is strongly recommended as ONLY material covered in class will be included in the tests. The instructor will also post weekly readings (optional for the students) on Connect to help students familiarize with the material and be on track with the course content.

## Course structure and activities

The course is taught in one section with the following structure:
+ 3 in-class lectures per week
+ 1 in-class tutorial per week
