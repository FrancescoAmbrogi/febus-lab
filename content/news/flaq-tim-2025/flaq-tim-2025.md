## Overview

The FLuid Alliance at Queen’s university had a strong presence at the 2025 1000 island meeting for fluid dynamics. Three faculty members (including myself) along with a postdoctoral fellow and several undergraduate and graduate students participated at this fantastic conference.

Organized by my fellow colleague and fluids enthusiast, [John Kurelek](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/john-w-kurelek.html) the conference was a stunning success with a large number of attendees form across Canada and US and VERY HIGH quality presentations.
