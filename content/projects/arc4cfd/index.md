##### Abstract

During the Winter term 2024 I took on this amazing opportunity at the University of Waterloo: develop an open-source, hands-on, completely asynchronous course with the objective to bridge the gap between small sclae CFD simulations and large-scale computations on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Advanced Research Computing for Computational Fluid Dynamics, or [ARC4CFD](https://arc4cfd.github.io/), is a 16-hour online, asynchronous course to help learners with a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and CFD bridge the knowledge gap towards the effective utilization of CFD on modern ARC resources.

##### Target audience

+ New graduate students in computational physics or engineering
+ Experimentalist and theoreticians complementing their work with numerical simulations on HPC
+ Undergraduate students on student design teams interested in leveraging CFD on HPC

The prerequisites for the course are listed [here](https://arc4cfd.github.io/prereqs/).

---

##### Learning outcomes

At the end of this course, the learner should be able to:

+ Define the main concepts in parallel and high performance computing
+ Conduct an a priori estimate of the computational cost of a CFD simulation
+ Explain the impact of modelling assumptions on HPC cost
+ Optimize simulation and parameters of a CFD problem for HPC
+ Develop a research data management strategy for a CFD workflow
