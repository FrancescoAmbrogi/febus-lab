description: "Identification, tracking, and characterization of large-scale turbulent structures in turbulent boundary layers with unsteady separation." 
summary: "The goal of this project is to methodically study the influence of shark-skin denticles on the physics of spatially-developing separating turbulent boundary layers (TBLs), and extend wall-resolved numerical simulations to an array of denticles mounted on a flat plate TBL with unsteady freestream pressure gradients."
