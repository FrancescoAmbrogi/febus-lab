description: "Wall-resolved Large Eddy Simulations (WRLES) of spatially developing turbulent boundary layers with strong unsteady presssure gradients." 
summary: "This project has the goal of furthering our understanding of the physics of separated turbulent boundary layers. By imposing a freestream forcing on the boundary layer we isolate the effect of the unsteady pressure gradient on the near-wall physics. This project has potential implications on real world systems such as pitching airfoils, turbine blades, and diffusers."
